# Custom-uBlock-Origin-Filter-Lists
A collection of customized adblock filter lists.

I did not create any of the lists these filters originated from.

This is here to serve as an archive of filters which I personally use, edit, and create according to my needs.

Firefox does not currently allow you to import filter lists from a local file, so just copy the raw url.

If you stumble across these filters and want to use one, go ahead. It's what they're here for.
