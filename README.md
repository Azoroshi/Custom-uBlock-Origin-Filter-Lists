# Custom-uBlock-Origin-Filter-Lists
A collection of customized adblock filter lists.

I did not create any of the lists these filters originated from. Element Filters v2, Mango Spill, and Peach Pit are lists I created myself from several different sources that I have heavily customized and added to.

This is here to serve as an archive of filters which I personally use, edit, and create according to my needs. Some of the original lists have either been removed or unmaintained for several years.

Firefox does not currently allow you to import filter lists from a local file, so just copy the raw url.

I do not use all of these filters. Using all of these at once would be wildly inefficient.

If you stumble across these filters and want to use one, go ahead. It's what they're here for.
