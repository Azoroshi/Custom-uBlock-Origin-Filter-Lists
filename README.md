# Custom-uBlock-Origin-Filter-Lists
A collection of customized adblock filter lists.

I did not create any of the lists these filters originated from. Some lists are a combination of filters I scraped from various sources along with a few custom filters I made myself.

This is here to serve as an archive of filters which I personally use, edit, and create according to my needs. Some of the originl lists have either been removed or unmaintained for several years.

Firefox does not currently allow you to import filter lists from a local file, so just copy the raw url.

If you stumble across these filters and want to use one, go ahead. It's what they're here for.
